            The mission of Animal Talks is twofold: first, to provide individual help with the pain, grief, and the
            healing,
            that comes with the death of a pet, your animal companion. It doesn't matter when it was or how it was, your
            heart is still broken. Please connect with us through email or phone. Tell us your story... and kindly leave
            whatever donation you can. We don't charge for the first hour of service.
            <br>
            <br>
            The second part of our mission is
            to
            serve the community. Animal Talks offers grief management workshops, small group discussions, a monthly
            pet-loss
            support group and informal talks. You’ll see us blessing the animals in the fields, on church steps and in
            the
            church itself on the Feast of St. Francis Day.
            <br>
            <br>
            As an ordained Animal Chaplain, Reverend Kaleel also works with community faith-leaders to help make animal
            rights awareness a part of every church’s vision. Please let us know if you'd like Animal Talks to connect
            with
            your community group, church or school. We hope you’ll find the site helpful and informative.

            Thanks for stopping by!
